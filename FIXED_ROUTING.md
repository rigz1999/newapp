- Investisseurs → `/investisseurs`
- Souscriptions → `/souscriptions`

## Implementation Details

### Each Component:
1. Uses `lazy()` import in App.tsx
2. Wrapped with `<Suspense>` and loading fallback
3. Has cleanup logic in `useEffect` return function
4. Fetches data only when mounted
5. Clears data when unmounted

### Navigation Flow:
1. Click sidebar link
2. Current page unmounts (data cleared)
3. Loading spinner shows while fetching new page code
4. New page mounts
5. New page fetches its data
6. New page renders

## Performance

- Initial load: 317 kB (Layout + core)
- Each page loads on demand
- Previous page data cleared from memory
- Fresh data on every mount
- Smooth navigation with loading states

All pages are now fully functional with proper lazy loading!
